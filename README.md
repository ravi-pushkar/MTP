Thermodynamically Compatible Finite Volume Scheme.

- The main aim is to mimic the SHTC (symmetric hyperbolic thermodynamic compatible) framework also on the discrete level.
- Directly discretizing the entropy inequality instead of the total energy conservation law. 
- The total energy conservation is obtained via an appropriate linear combination as a consequence of the thermodynamically compatible discretization of all other equations.
- Firstly, the system is studied in 1D in gravity-free space with zero viscosity and zero additional fluxes.
- Finally, various additional terms like dissipative terms and correction terms are added to the system.
