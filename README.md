Thermodynamically Compatible Finite Volume Scheme.

We will consider finite-volume methods. These are popular in astrophysics because they are based on the integral form of the conservative equations and properly conserve mass, momentum, and energy. We will consider an Eulerian grid: the grid is fixed and the fluid moves through it. We will be explicit in time: the new solution depends only on the previous state.
